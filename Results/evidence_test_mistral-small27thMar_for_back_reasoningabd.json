The statement correctly infers that the number of losses can be determined by subtracting the number of wins from the total games played. However, the external sources do not provide the total number of games played this season, making it impossible to calculate the number of losses and determine if the Raptors have a winning record.\n\nFinal Question: How many games have the Toronto Raptors played this season, and what is their total number of losses?"
