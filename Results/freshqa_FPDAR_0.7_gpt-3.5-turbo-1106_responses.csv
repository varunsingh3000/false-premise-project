Although, since humans are technically animals, one could say that the first animal sent to the Moon was Neil Armstrong. He belonged to the species Homo sapiens.",,"The conclusion that Neil Armstrong, as a human, was the first animal to land on the moon is not accurate.","There is no verifiable evidence that any non-human animal was sent to the Moon, and the widely accepted understanding is that only human astronauts have visited the Moon. This conclusion may have been reached based on a technical interpretation, it does not align with established scientific knowledge.",Was Neil Armstrong technically the first animal to land on the moon?,"{'Answer:': 'No animals were ever sent to the Moon.

1,What is the name of Leonardo DiCaprio's third child?,Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,TRUE,"Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children, so he does not have a third child.",,"The conclusion is plausible because the actor, who is known to the public, is not reported to have any children.","The conclusion that Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children is plausible based on the absence of reports and documentation regarding his fathering any children. This aligns with the public's broader understanding of the actor's personal life. Additionally, reputable sources and the absence of evidence regarding his children support this conclusion.",Does Leonardo DiCaprio have any children?,"{'Answer:': 'Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children, so he does not have a third child.', 'Source:': 'Quora (https://www.quora.com/How-many-women-has-Leonardo-DiCaprio-dated-How-many-did-he-marry-and-how-many-children-does-he-have)', 'Premise of the Question:': 'Invalid.

2,What year did the first human land on Mars?,No humans have been to Mars yet.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,TRUE,"The first human has not landed on Mars yet. The first successful Mars landing was by the Soviet Union's Mars 3 in 1971. There are proposed crewed missions to Mars for the 2030s, but no human has landed on Mars as of now.",,The first human has not yet landed on Mars.,"The available sources and general knowledge indicate that the first successful Mars landing was accomplished by the Soviet Union's Mars 3 in 1971. Proposed crewed missions to Mars are suggested for the 2030s, but as of now, no human has eer landed on Mars. Therefore, the conclusion that the first human has not yet landed on Mars is plausible based on the available evidence and background knowledge.",Has any human landed on Mars?,"{'Answer:': ""The first human has not landed on Mars yet.

4,Why are all quickly verifiable problems also quickly solvable?,This is the P versus NP problem and it remains open.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,TRUE,Not all quickly verifiable problems are quickly solvable. There are problems that can be verified in polynomial time but do not have a known polynomial time solution.,,"The plausibility of the conclusion depends on various factors related to the difficulty of verifying and solving different types of problems. There may be scenarios where the verification process is efficient but finding the solution is inherently complex, thus leading to the phenomenon observed.","The observed phenomenon may be attributed to the inherent complexity of certain problems, making it difficult to efficiently find a solution despite the verification process being feasible within a polynomial time. It is plausible that there exist problems for which verifying the solution is more straightforward than finding the solution itself, thereby supporting the conclusion.",Are there problems that can be verified in polynomial time but do not have a known polynomial time solution?,"{'Answer:': 'Not all quickly verifiable problems are quickly solvable.
