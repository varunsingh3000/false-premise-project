        "bck_final_ans_exp": "The available information indicates that the first crewed Mars mission is proposed for the 2030s, and historical data shows that there have been Mars flybys and landings by unmanned probes. Therefore, it is plausible that as of 2023, no human has landed on Mars. This conclusion aligns with our broader understanding of the current state of space exploration.",
