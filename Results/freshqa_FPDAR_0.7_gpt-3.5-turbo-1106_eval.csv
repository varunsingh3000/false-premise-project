0,What is the name of the first animal to land on the moon?,No animal has ever landed on the moon yet.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,"No animals were ever sent to the Moon. Although, since humans are technically animals, one could say that the first animal sent to the Moon was Neil Armstrong. He belonged to the species Homo sapiens.",,The conclusion is not plausible.,"Humans technically belong to the animal kingdom, so it is true that homo sapiens are animals. However, the claim that Neil Armstrong was the first animal to be sent to the Moon is not plausible. The general public's understanding and historical records affirm that no animals were ever sent to the Moon, and the journey was made by human astronauts. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically align with our broader knowledge and is not credible.",Who was the first animal to go on the moon?,"{'Answer:': 'No animals were ever sent to the Moon.

1,What is the name of Leonardo DiCaprio's third child?,Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,"Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children, so he does not have a third child.",,It is plausible that Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children.,"Given that there is no evidence of Leonardo DiCaprio having children and also testimony that he has no biological siblings, the conclusion that he does not have a third child is logically plausible and aligns with our broader understanding of his personal life. This conclusion is supported by available evidence and general knowledge.",Does Leonardo DiCaprio have any children?,"{'Answer:': 'Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children, so he does not have a third child.', 'Source:': 'Quora (https://www.quora.com/How-many-women-has-Leonardo-DiCaprio-dated-How-many-did-he-marry-and-how-many-children-does-he-have)', 'Premise of the Question:': 'Invalid', 'Explanation:': ''}",0.6763001084327698,Correct
2,What year did the first human land on Mars?,No humans have been to Mars yet.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,"The first human has not landed on Mars yet. The first successful Mars landing was by the Soviet Union's Mars 3 in 1971. There are proposed crewed missions to Mars for the 2030s, but no human has landed on Mars as of now.",,"The first human has not landed on Mars, and the proposed crewed missions are targeted for the 2030s.","The first successful Mars landing occurred in 1971 by the Soviet Union's Mars 3, but no human has landed on Mars as of now. While there are proposed crewed missions to Mars, these have not yet taken place, and as of the present time, no humans have landed on Mars. This conclusion aligns with the historical accomplishments regarding Mars exploration and the current proposed missions.",Has a human ever landed on Mars?,"{'Answer:': ""The first human has not landed on Mars yet.

3,What was the name of the Zodiac killer?,The Zodiac Killer has not been identified.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,"The name of the Zodiac killer remains unknown, and there is no definitive evidence pointing to a single suspect.",,The identity of the Zodiac killer remains unknown and no single suspect has been conclusively identified.,"The available evidence suggests various suspects, but none have been definitively linked to the Zodiac killings. The lack of definitive evidence and the existence of multiple potential suspects indicate that the identity of the Zodiac killer is still a mystery. Therefore, the conclusion that the name of the Zodiac killer remains unknown and that there is no definitive evidence pointing to a single suspect is plausible.",Who is the true identity of the Zodiac killer and is there conclusive evidence pointing to a single suspect?,"{'Answer:': 'The name of the Zodiac killer remains unknown, and there is no definitive evidence pointing to a single suspect.', 'Source:': 'Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_Killer#:~:text=Of%20the%20four%20ciphers%20he,offender%20who%20died%20in%201992.)', 'Premise of the Question:': 'Valid', 'Explanation:': ''}",0.7764410972595215,Correct
4,Why are all quickly verifiable problems also quickly solvable?,This is the P versus NP problem and it remains open.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,Not all quickly verifiable problems are quickly solvable. Some problems may have a quick verification process but no known quick solution.,,The observed phenomenon is plausible. Some problems may have a quick verification process but no known quick solution.,"While NP problems are verifiable in polynomial time, not all of them currently have known solutions that can be solved in polynomial time. This discrepancy illustrates that not all quickly verifiable problems are quickly solvable, supporting the plausibility of the observed phenomenon. This aligns with the broader understanding of computational complexity and problem-solving abilities. Therefore, the conclusion is logically coherent given the available evidence and background knowledge.",Are there problems that can be verified in polynomial time but are not known to have a polynomial time solution?,"{'Answer:': 'Not all quickly verifiable problems are quickly solvable. Some problems may have a quick verification process but no known quick solution.', 'Source:': 'https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-task-that-is-solvable-in-polynomial-time-but-not-verifiable-in-polynomial-time', 'Premise of the Question:': 'Invalid', 'Explanation:': ''}",0.4685453772544861,Correct
