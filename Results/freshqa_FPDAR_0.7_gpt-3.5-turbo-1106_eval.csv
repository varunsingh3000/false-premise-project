0,What is the name of the first animal to land on the moon?,No animal has ever landed on the moon yet.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,"No animals were ever sent to the Moon. Although, since humans are technically animals, one could say that the first animal sent to the Moon was Neil Armstrong. He belonged to the species Homo sapiens.",,The conclusion is not plausible based on the evidence provided and general knowledge.,"According to general knowledge and historical record, the first animal to land on the moon was not Neil Armstrong, but rather the first animal was a human due to both being under the umbrella ""animals"". This means the conclusion provided is not aligning with general historical facts and therefore is not plausible.","Was Neil Armstrong the first animal to land on the moon, considering that humans are technically animals?","{'Answer:': 'No animals were ever sent to the Moon.

1,What is the name of Leonardo DiCaprio's third child?,Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,"Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children, so he does not have a third child.",,The conclusion is plausible based on the information provided and general knowledge.,"Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children, as indicated in the information provided and confirmed through general knowledge. Therefore, the conclusion that he does not have a third child is logically consistent with this.",Does Leonardo DiCaprio have any children?,"{'Answer:': 'Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children, so he does not have a third child.', 'Source:': 'Quora (https://www.quora.com/How-many-women-has-Leonardo-DiCaprio-dated-How-many-did-he-marry-and-how-many-children-does-he-have)', 'Premise of the Question:': 'Invalid', 'Explanation:': ''}",0.6762999892234802,Correct
2,What year did the first human land on Mars?,No humans have been to Mars yet.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,"The first human has not landed on Mars yet. The first successful Mars landing was by the Soviet Union's Mars 3 in 1971. There are proposed crewed missions to Mars for the 2030s, but no human has landed on Mars as of now.",,The conclusion that the first human has not landed on Mars yet is plausible given that there are currently no reported human landings on Mars.,"Based on available information and general knowledge, the conclusion is logical. The data provided indicates that the first successful Mars landing was by the Soviet Union's Mars 3 in 1971, and proposed crewed missions to Mars are set for the 2030s, aligning with our broader understanding that no human has landed on Mars as of now.",Has a human ever landed on Mars?,"{'Answer:': ""The first human has not landed on Mars yet.

3,What was the name of the Zodiac killer?,The Zodiac Killer has not been identified.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,"The name of the Zodiac killer remains unknown, and there is no definitive evidence pointing to a single suspect.",,The name of the Zodiac killer remains unknown and there is no definitive evidence of a single suspect.,"The lack of definite evidence and the presence of multiple theories and suspects, coupled with the historical context of the Zodiac killer case, suggest that the conclusion is plausible. The cases of other renowned unidentified and elusive serial killers also support the notion that the true identity of the Zodiac killer may never be conclusively discovered. Therefore, the conclusion aligns with the available evidence and our broader understanding of unsolved criminal cases.","What evidence exists that can definitively identify the Zodiac killer, and is there a single likely suspect at this point?","{'Answer:': 'The name of the Zodiac killer remains unknown, and there is no definitive evidence pointing to a single suspect.', 'Source:': 'Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_Killer#:~:text=Of%20the%20four%20ciphers%20he,offender%20who%20died%20in%201992.)', 'Premise of the Question:': 'Valid', 'Explanation:': ''}",0.7671225666999817,Correct
4,Why are all quickly verifiable problems also quickly solvable?,This is the P versus NP problem and it remains open.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,Not all quickly verifiable problems are quickly solvable. Some problems may have a quick verification process but no known quick solution.,,It is plausible that some problems have a quick verification process but no known quick solution.,"The observed evidence indicates that not all problems that can be quickly verified are also quickly solvable. This could be due to the existence of problems for which a solution verification process can be efficiently completed, even if a quick solution is not currently known. Therefore, it is plausible that certain problems may have a fast verification mechanism but lack a known fast solution. This aligns with our broader understanding of the complexity of problem-solving and computational processes. Therefore, the conclusion is logically reasonable based on the available evidence and background knowledge.",Is there a class of problems that have a quick verification process but no known quick solution?,"{'Answer:': 'Not all quickly verifiable problems are quickly solvable. Some problems may have a quick verification process but no known quick solution.', 'Source:': 'https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-task-that-is-solvable-in-polynomial-time-but-not-verifiable-in-polynomial-time', 'Premise of the Question:': 'Invalid', 'Explanation:': ''}",0.6452894806861877,Correct
