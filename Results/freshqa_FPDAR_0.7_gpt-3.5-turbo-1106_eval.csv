0,What is the name of the first animal to land on the moon?,No animal has ever landed on the moon yet.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,"No animals were ever sent to the Moon. Although, since humans are technically animals, one could say that the first animal sent to the Moon was Neil Armstrong. He belonged to the species Homo sapiens.",,"The conclusion is plausible because the evidence suggests that no animals were sent to the Moon, making the statement about Neil Armstrong the first suspected. Additional well-known facts about the Moon landing further support this conclusion.","The conclusion is credible based on the evidence provided. There is no documentation or historical record of any animals being sent to the Moon. Given the absence of evidence for animal involvement in the lunar landing, the deductive reasoning leading to the conclusion is logical and coherent. Furthermore, the knowledge that humans are biological animals helps substantiate the premise â€“ thus concluding that Neil Armstrong, the first man on the Moon, was the first ""animal"" to land on the Moon makes logical sense.","Was Neil Armstrong the first ""animal"" to land on the moon?","{'Answer:': 'No animals were ever sent to the Moon.

1,What is the name of Leonardo DiCaprio's third child?,Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children.,,It is plausible that Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children.,"While the initial source did not explicitly corroborate the claim, a related source confirmed that DiCaprio has never been married and further detailed his relationships without any mention of children. Additionally, general knowledge and common sources also do not list any children for him. Therefore, it is plausible that Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children.",Does Leonardo DiCaprio have any children?,"{'Answer:': 'Leonardo DiCaprio does not have any children.', 'Source:': 'Quora (https://www.quora.com/How-many-women-has-Leonardo-DiCaprio-dated-How-many-did-he-marry-and-how-many-children-does-he-have)', 'Premise of the Question:': 'Invalid.

2,What year did the first human land on Mars?,No humans have been to Mars yet.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,"The first human has not landed on Mars yet. The first successful Mars landing was by the Soviet Union's Mars 3 in 1971. There are proposed crewed missions to Mars for the 2030s, but no human has landed on Mars as of now.",,The conclusion that the first human has not landed on Mars yet aligns with our current understanding and the provided evidence.,"The evidence indicates that the Soviet Union's Mars 3 in 1971 was the first successful Mars landing. Additionally, it is known that there are proposed crewed missions to Mars for the 2030s, but no human has actually landed on Mars as of now. Therefore, it is plausible to conclude that the first human has not landed on Mars yet based on the information available.",Has a human landed on Mars as of now?,"{'Answer:': ""The first human has not landed on Mars yet.

3,What was the name of the Zodiac killer?,The Zodiac Killer has not been identified.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,"The name of the Zodiac killer remains unknown, and there is no definitive evidence pointing to a single suspect.",,The name of the Zodiac killer remains unknown with no definitive evidence pointing to a single suspect.,"The conclusion that the identity of the Zodiac killer remains unknown is highly plausible considering the lack of concrete evidence pointing to any single suspect. While there have been various theories and suspects, no definitive proof has emerged to confirm the true identity of the killer. This aligns with our broader understanding of the case and the absence of conclusive evidence despite extensive investigations and public interest. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the name of the Zodiac killer is undisclosed. This conclusion is consistent with the available evidence and the broader context of the case.",Who is the most likely suspect believed to be the Zodiac killer and what evidence supports this suspicion?,"{'Answer:': 'The name of the Zodiac killer remains unknown, and there is no definitive evidence pointing to a single suspect.', 'Source:': 'Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_Killer#:~:text=Of%20the%20four%20ciphers%20he,offender%20who%20died%20in%201992.)', 'Premise of the Question:': 'Valid', 'Explanation:': ''}",0.7784033417701721,Correct
4,Why are all quickly verifiable problems also quickly solvable?,This is the P versus NP problem and it remains open.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,Not all quickly verifiable problems are quickly solvable. Some problems may have a quick verification process but no known quick solution.,,It is plausible that some problems may have a quick verification process but no known quick solution.,"The evidence provided suggests that not all problems with quick verification processes necessarily have quick solutions. This is consistent with the concept of problems being verifiable in polynomial time in the broader context of computational complexity. Therefore, the conclusion derived from the observation aligns with our understanding of such problems and their solvability.",Are there problems that can be verified in polynomial time but do not have a known polynomial time solution?,"{'Answer:': 'Not all quickly verifiable problems are quickly solvable.
