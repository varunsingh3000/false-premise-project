If there have been any new announcements or developments regarding the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series after that date, I may not have the most current information. I recommend consulting official sources or the latest updates from the author, Rick Riordan, for the most accurate information about the series.\nBased on the above conversation, provide your final answer and explanation for the                      question in the following format: Final Answer: Explanation: \n\nFinal Answer: As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there are only five books in the original Percy Jackson & the Olympians series by Rick Riordan.\n\nExplanation: The original Percy Jackson & the Olympians series consists of \"The Lightning Thief,\" \"The Sea of Monsters,\" \"The Titan's Curse,\" \"The Battle of the Labyrinth,\" and \"The Last Olympian.\" There is no official announcement or information about a seventh book titled \"Wrath of the Triple Goddess\" scheduled for release in 2024 as of my last knowledge update.
