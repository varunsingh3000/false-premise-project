Therefore, the answer to this question is null. This conclusion logically follows from the available evidence and aligns with our broader understanding of reality. The observation that no animals have been sent to the moon is consistent with historical records and scientific knowledge, and it is reasonable to assume that if animals had been sent to the moon, it would have been documented and widely known. Additionally, the fact that the first human to walk on the moon, Neil Armstrong, belonged to the species Homo sapiens, does not provide any evidence for the existence of animals on the moon.",

This information is consistent with general knowledge of the world, as there is no public record of Leonardo DiCaprio having any children.
