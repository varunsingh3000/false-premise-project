There are various explanations to why space is not bright even in the presence of light: the best solution at present is that the universe is not infinitely old; it is somewhere around 15 billion years old. That means we can only see objects as far away as the distance light can travel in 15 billion years. The light from stars farther away than that has not yet had time to reach us and so can't contribute to making the sky bright. Another reason that the sky may not be bright with the visible light of all the stars is because when a source of light is moving away from you, the wavelength of that light is made longer (which for light means more red). This means that the light from stars that are moving away from us will become shifted towards red, and may shift so far that it is no longer visible at all.",

        "fwd_final_ans_exp": "The reason there is no light in space is because space is a near-perfect vacuum, meaning it has very few particles, including molecules of gas that can scatter light.

This is different from the Earth's atmosphere, where there are plenty of molecules in the air that scatter sunlight in all directions, making the sky appear blue during the day.",

This aligns with our understanding of space as a vacuum. However, it is important to note that this observation alone does not provide conclusive evidence for the absence of light in all of space. There are other factors that could contribute to the appearance of darkness, such as the distance of the sun from the observer, the presence of other celestial bodies, and the quality of the observer's vision.

This implies that betta fish do not carry their young inside their bodies like mammals do during pregnancy. Instead, they lay eggs that are fertilized externally, and the male betta fish plays a role in collecting and caring for the eggs. This is consistent with our general knowledge of how fish reproduce.
