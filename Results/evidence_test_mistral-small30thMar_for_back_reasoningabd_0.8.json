This information is supported by the related questions, which mention the film's expired American copyright.

According to the observation, there is no specific mention of Father's Day 2023 being on June 18.\n\nFinal Explanation: The observation details that Father's Day is celebrated on the third Sunday of June, and this varies annually. However, there is no mention of Father's Day being on June 18, 2023, specifically. In fact, the surrounding information suggests that Father's Day 2024 will be on June 16. Thus, it is unlikely that Father's Day 2023 would be on June 18.\n\nFinal Question: Based on the available information, what is the actual date of Father's Day in 2023?"
