        "true_ans": "There is lots of light in space. There are various explanations to why space is not bright even in the presence of light: the best solution at present is that the universe is not infinitely old; it is somewhere around 15 billion years old. That means we can only see objects as far away as the distance light can travel in 15 billion years. The light from stars farther away than that has not yet had time to reach us and so can't contribute to making the sky bright. Another reason that the sky may not be bright with the visible light of all the stars is because when a source of light is moving away from you, the wavelength of that light is made longer (which for light means more red). This means that the light from stars that are moving away from us will become shifted towards red, and may shift so far that it is no longer visible at all.",
