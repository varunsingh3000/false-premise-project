To determine his age, we subtract his birth year from the current year, which gives us 78 years. However, since he has not yet reached his birthday in 2023, we need to account for the remaining days in the year. By adding up the number of days in the remaining months and dividing by the total number of days in a year (365), we get a fraction of a year (0.57) that we subtract from the whole-year difference. This gives us an approximate age of 77.58 years.\n\nFinal Question: How old is the current president of Brazil, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva?"

            "The Megalodon is expected to have gone extinct around 3.6 million years ago. The Megalodon, a massive prehistoric shark species, is believed to have gone extinct around 3.6 million years ago. This conclusion is drawn from the fossil record, which indicates that the earliest Megalodon fossils date back approximately 20 million years, while the most recent ones are around 3.6 million years old. The decline of the Megalodon is attributed to a combination of factors, including a decrease in global water temperature, the loss of prey species, and competition from other predators like the great white shark.\nBased on the above discussion, provide an explanation regarding the topic being discussed, the veracity of the discussion and whether it is logical using your knowledge and the external sources. Based on your explanation provide your answer and explanation.

This conclusion is based on the fossil record, which indicates that the earliest Megalodon fossils date back approximately 20 million years, while the most recent ones are around 3.6 million years old. The decline of the Megalodon is attributed to a combination of factors, including a decrease in global water temperature, the loss of prey species, and competition from other predators like the great white shark.

Use the following format: Final Answer: Final Explanation: Final Question:\nFinal Answer: The Soviet Union and Germany signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a non-aggression agreement, on August 23, 1939, which secretly included a plan to divide Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, and the Soviet Union joined the invasion on September 17, 1939, ultimately leading to the start of World War II.\n\nFinal Explanation: The external sources provided support the discussion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Germany. The pact was signed on August 23, 1939, and included a secret agreement to divide Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence (<https://www.britannica.com/event/German-Soviet-Nonaggression-Pact>). Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, and the Soviet Union joined the invasion on September 17, 1939 (<https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/invasion-of-poland-fall-1939>). This invasion ultimately led to the start of World War II. The veracity of the discussion is supported by the external sources, and it is logical as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact provided a strategic advantage for both the Soviet Union and Germany in their expansionist goals.\n\nFinal Question: What was the significance of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Germany in the lead-up to World War II?"

Use the following format: Final Answer: Final Explanation: Final Question:\nFinal Answer: The Chinese paddlefish is extinct, with no individuals left in the wild or in captivity.\n\nFinal Explanation: The Chinese paddlefish, a critically endangered species, was officially declared extinct in July 2022 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. The last known specimen was caught in 2003, and extensive surveys since then have failed to find any evidence of the species' survival. Researchers had hoped to artificially breed the species, but with no individuals existing in captivity and no living tissues conserved, this is no longer possible.\n\nFinal Question: Has the Chinese paddlefish been declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)?"

This discrepancy between professional critic and audience reviews is not uncommon and can be attributed to various factors, such as differing expectations or interpretations of the series.

The Tomatometer score is a representation of professional critic reviews, while the audience score reflects the opinions of general viewers. In the case of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the Tomatometer score is 84% based on 112 reviews, indicating that the majority of professional critics have given positive reviews for the first season. However, the audience score is significantly lower at 38% based on over 25,000 ratings, indicating that the general audience has not been as positive in their evaluations of the show.\n\nThis discrepancy between professional critic and audience reviews is not uncommon and can be attributed to various factors, such as differing expectations or interpretations of the series. For example, some viewers may have had high expectations for the show based on their love for the original Lord of the Rings movies, and may have been disappointed when those expectations were not met. Additionally, some viewers may have criticized the show's diversity, as mentioned in one of the external sources.\n\nOverall, while The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power has received positive reviews from professional critics, it is important to consider the opinions of general viewers as well. The lower audience score suggests that the show may not have resonated as well with audiences as it has with critics, and may be a point of consideration for those thinking about watching the show."
