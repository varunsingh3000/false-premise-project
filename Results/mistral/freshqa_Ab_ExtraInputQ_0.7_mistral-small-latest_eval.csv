0,What is the name of the first animal to land on the moon?,No animal has ever landed on the moon yet.,before 2022,one-hop,slow-changing,True,No animal was ever sent to the moon.,,It is plausible that no animal has ever landed on the moon.,"The available evidence indicates that the first and only beings to land on the moon are humans.

Moreover, relevant historical records show that animal space missions from both the US and Soviet Union have comprised suborbital experiments; no such mission intended to land an animal on the moon took place. Given that there are had plans to diversify lifeforms aboard spacecrafts, this triangle of logic demonstrates the likelihood that no animals, in the conventional definition limited to non-human beings, ever stepped foot on lunar soil.","Which types of beings were the first to step onto the lunar surface, if not animals?","{'Answer:': 'No animal was ever sent to the moon.', 'Source:': 'https://homework.study.com/explanation/what-was-the-first-animal-to-land-on-the-moon.html#:~:text=Answer%20and%20Explanation%3A%20No%20animals%20were%20ever%20sent%20to%20the%20Moon.%20Although%2C%20since%20humans%20are%20technically%20animals%2C%20one%20could%20say%20that%20the%20first%20animal%20sent%20to%20the%20Moon%20was%20Neil%20Armstrong.%20He%20belonged%20to%20the%20species%20Homo%20sapiens.', 'Premise of the Question:': 'Invalid.
