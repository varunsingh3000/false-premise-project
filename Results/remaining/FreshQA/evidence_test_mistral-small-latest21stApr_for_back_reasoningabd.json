Related questions suggest that the A17 Pro Bionic is the fastest processor on the latest iPhone models and that the iPhone 15 Pro has this chipset. These pieces of information, combined with general knowledge about Apple's naming conventions for processors (where a higher number usually indicates a more powerful processor), suggest that the A17 Pro Bionic is indeed the most powerful processor on the latest iPhone models.
