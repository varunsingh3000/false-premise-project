        "fwd_final_ans_exp": "The question asks about the first animal to land on the moon. However, according to the provided sources, no animals were ever sent to the moon. The first living beings on the moon were humans, who are classified as animals in the biological taxonomy.",

        "bck_final_ans_exp": "The provided text states that no animals were ever sent to the moon. However, it suggests that humans, being a type of animal, could be considered the first animals to land on the moon. This aligns with historical facts as Neil Armstrong was the first human to step onto the moon's surface. Therefore, in a technical sense, he was the first \"animal\" to land on the moon.",

        "bck_final_ans_exp": "The observation provides information about Leonardo DiCaprio, including his birth name, number of siblings, relationships, and whether he has children. It's stated that he has never been married and has no children. The organic results also do not indicate that he has any children. Therefore, it logically follows that Leonardo DiCaprio does not have a third child, as he has no children at all. This conclusion aligns with general knowledge about Leonardo DiCaprio and is supported by the evidence provided in the observation.",

        "true_ans": "No humans have been to Mars yet.",

        "fwd_final_ans_exp": "The question asks about the first human landing on Mars. However, as of 2023, no human has landed on Mars. The external sources confirm that successful Mars landings have been conducted by the Soviet Union, the United States, and China, but these were all unmanned missions.",

        "bck_final_ans_exp": "The provided information includes details about successful Mars landings by the Soviet Union, the United States, and China, as well as plans for future crewed missions. However, none of the information mentions a human landing on Mars. Additionally, the \"Human mission to Mars\" organic result indicates that the first crewed mission to Mars, including sending astronauts to Mars, orbiting Mars, and returning to Earth, is proposed for the 2030s. This aligns with our broader understanding of reality, as current technology and space travel capabilities do not yet allow humans to land on Mars. Therefore, it is a plausible conclusion that no human has landed on Mars as of the current year.",
