91,when does a car battery go flat,"Most car batteries are made to last between two and six years with the average life being four years. Batteries are filled with acid and start deteriorating internally from day one. Heat, cold, vibration, and electrical loads all go towards reducing the lifespan. Car batteries can also go flat due to other reasons including leaving the lights on, frequent short trips, leaving the vehicle parked for a long time, extreme temperatures, faulty parts, incorrect fitment, and accessories that drain your battery.","A car battery can go flat after sitting unused for about two weeks to four months, depending on its condition, frequency of use, and temperature.","The lifespan of a car battery can vary based on several factors such as the condition of the battery, the frequency of use, and the temperature. It can last from two weeks to four months without use, depending on these factors.","The claim that a car battery can go flat after sitting unused for about two weeks to four months is plausible, considering factors such as battery condition, frequency of use, and temperature.","The plausibility of the claim is supported by the fact that a car battery's lifespan can be affected by factors such as its condition, frequency of use, and temperature.

331,why is there no light in space,"There is lots of light in space. There are various explanations to why space is not bright even in the presence of light: the best solution at present is that the universe is not infinitely old; it is somewhere around 15 billion years old. That means we can only see objects as far away as the distance light can travel in 15 billion years. The light from stars farther away than that has not yet had time to reach us and so can't contribute to making the sky bright. Another reason that the sky may not be bright with the visible light of all the stars is because when a source of light is moving away from you, the wavelength of that light is made longer (which for light means more red). This means that the light from stars that are moving away from us will become shifted towards red, and may shift so far that it is no longer visible at all.","There is no light in space because space is a near-perfect vacuum, with exceedingly few particles to scatter or re-radiate light.","The reason there is no light in space is that space is a near-perfect vacuum, meaning there are exceedingly few particles to scatter or re-radiate light.
