The existing walls deteriorated from about 200 CE to about 1400 CE, and then the Ming Dynasty constructed what we now call the Great Wall from 1368\u20131644. Therefore, while parts of the wall may have collapsed or deteriorated, the entire structure did not collapse.\n\nFinal Question: How did the Great Wall of China deteriorate over time, and what led to its construction during the Ming Dynasty?"
