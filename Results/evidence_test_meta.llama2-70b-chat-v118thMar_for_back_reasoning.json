The premise of the question is that quickly verifiable problems can be solved in polynomial time, and the question asks why this is the case.\nIs this correct? Please provide your final answer and explanation for the question in the following format: Forward Answer: Forward Explanation: \n\nNo, that is not correct.\n\nForward Answer: False.\n\nForward Explanation:\n\nThe statement that quickly verifiable problems are also quickly solvable is not always true. While it is true that some problems that can be verified quickly can also be solved quickly, it is not a general property of quickly verifiable problems.\n\nA problem is considered quickly verifiable if a proposed solution can be verified in polynomial time. However, whether a problem can be solved quickly or not depends on the algorithm used to solve it, and not all problems that can be verified quickly can be solved quickly.\n\nFor example, consider the problem of determining whether a given number is prime. This problem can be verified quickly by testing whether the number has any factors, but it cannot be solved quickly in general because it is not known whether there is a fast algorithm for factoring large numbers.\n\nTherefore, while quickly verifiable problems can often be solved quickly, it is not a guarantee that they can be solved quickly, and it is important to consider the specifics of the problem and the algorithm used to solve it when determining whether a problem can be solved quickly."
