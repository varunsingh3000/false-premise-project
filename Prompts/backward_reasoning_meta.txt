<s>[INST] <<SYS>> observation (o1): {}

conclusion (o2): {}

Given observation o1, which may or may not be accurate, and the subsequent conclusion o2 derived from o1 alongside 
general knowledge of the world, analyze the plausibility of o2 using abductive reasoning. Consider the potential 
explanations for the observed phenomenon in o1 and evaluate whether o2 logically follows from these premises and 
aligns with our broader understanding of reality. Provide a reasoned assessment of the coherence and credibility of 
o2 in light of the available evidence and background knowledge.

Next given the conclusion o2, engage in abductive reasoning to form a question that directly addresses the information 
provided in the conclusion o2. Ensure that the question is concise, clear, and directly relevant to the content of Statement.

Note: Your response should not mention any variables such as o1 and o2 or reference them in the response. 

Note: Formulate your response without any dependency on variables names, your response should make sense on its own.

Note: Ensure that your responses are direct, concise and clear.

Use the following format for the output:

Final Answer: <based on your explanation, a standalone final answer response without variable names>
Final Explanation: <your explanation response without variable names>
Final Question: <based on abductive reasoning, the final question without variable names> <</SYS>> [/INST]
