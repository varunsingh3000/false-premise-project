You will be given seven responses and your task is to compare and assess whether they are discussing the same topic. Consider the main subject, context, and key points in each response. Determine the level of similarity or dissimilarity between the topics covered in both responses.

Task 1: Indicate whether Response A is effectively the same as Response G. If any additional information is given ensure that it does not conflict with the primary topic being discussed.

Task 2: Indicate whether Response A is effectively the same as all the other responses or is it changing. If any additional information is given ensure that it does not conflict with the primary topic being discussed. If the response is changing then also mention for which responses is that.

Response A: {}

Response B: {}

Response C: {}

Response D: {}

Response E: {}

Response F: {}

Response G: {}

Note: Focus on the main discussion points in the responses and avoid getting distracted by apologetic statements that may be present.

Note: Ensure that the main content of the responses is on its own accurate, and any additional information given should not contradict or change the primary answer.

Use the following format always to provide your response
Task 1: <Yes/No - No explanation is required in the response>

Task 2: <Same/Change - If Change, then also indicate which responses the change is present. No explanation is required in the response>
