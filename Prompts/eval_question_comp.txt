Question 1: Why does Mars have three moons?
Answer 1: Mars does not have three moons.

Question 2: How many moons does Mars have?
Answer 2: Mars has two moons Deimos and Phobos.

comment: These two questions and their responses are nearly identifical. Answer 1 directly answers that Mars does not have three moons
whereas Answer 2 provides that information indirectly and also mentions the moons of Mars. This is also because the questions for each
of these answers are phrased slightly different but overall the questions and their answers provide the same information.
evaluation: identical 

Question 1: Is basketball an olympic sport?
Answer 1: Yes, basketball is an olympic sport since it was first contested for medal in 1936.

Question 2: When did basketball become a provisonal sport in the olympics?
Answer 2: Basketball became a provisonal sport in the year 2000 after much consideration.

comment: These two questions and their responses are different. Both the answers directly answer their respective questions.
However the answers themselves are different because the questions are different. Questions asks whether basketball is an olympic 
sport whereas Question 2 enquires when did basketball gain the status of a provisonal sport in the olympics which is different in
terms of the information being provided. Questions 2 assumes that basketball is a provisional whereas Question 1 asks whether
basketball is an olympic sport and this changes their answers significantly.
