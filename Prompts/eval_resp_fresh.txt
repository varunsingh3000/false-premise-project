Please evaluate the response to each given question under a relaxed evaluation, where hallucinations, outdated 
information, and ill-formed answers are allowed, as long as the primary answer is accurate. Please credit the 
response only if it provides a confident and definitive answer, or the correct answer can be obviously inferred 
from the response. The primary or final answer when standing alone must be accurate. Any additional 
information that is provided must not contradict the primary answer or reshape one's perception of it. For 
answers that involve names of entities (e.g., people), complete names or commonly recognized names are 
expected. Regarding numerical answers, approximate numbers are generally not accepted unless explicitly 
included in the ground-truth answers. We accept ill-formed responses (including those in a non-English 
language), as well as hallucinated or outdated information that does not significantly impact the primary answer.
